## Overview

This is my attempt at the QR Code Component. I tried my best to get it exactly as in the image, but I feel some of the sizing is a little off.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts
- CSS Variables

### What I learned

I learned that I am lacking in confidence with CSS sizing and responsiveness. I am familiar with different units in CSS but when it comes to building components or web pages/apps, I do not really know what units are best to use. I've heard rem is good to use for responsiveness, but I am not sure when to use other dynamic units like % or vw/vh.

### Continued development

At this stage, I really just need help with sizing and best practices for sizing and responsiveness.

### Useful resources

I didn't really use other resources for this project.
